Nike-inspired Clone for the company named "Sellsy" Interview - Technical Assessment  In response to Sellsy's technical interview challenge, this repository presents a swift attempt at replicating Nike's design aesthetics.
The project has been implemented using VueJS to closely resemble the Nike website's appearance.  

**Disclaimer**: This project is solely for demonstrative and educational purposes. It is not an official project in any kind of way. Feel free to explore the code and structure to understand the design choices made for this project.
Obviously, the .env file is included in the repository for the sake of simplicity. In a real-world scenario, it would be ignored by git and stored in a secure location.
